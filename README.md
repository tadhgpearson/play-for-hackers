# Play Framework for Hackers
### An interactive guide to some rapid prototyping features of the Play! Framework

This project is a presentation in the form of a web application which runs in Play.
The idea is that by following the steps of this presentation of the Play Framework in the source code, you can also see and understand how certain features of the framework operate in practice.

## Getting started

First, clone this project!

In order to run the application, you should download an install Play! Framework from www.playframework.com
This version of the application is for Play! 2.2.2. Get the standard installation and unzip it to a path with no spaces (eg. D:\java)
When you unzip, a new play-2.2.2 folder will be created at that path, add this to your PATH environement variable (eg. D:\java\play-2.2.2)

Now, open a command prompt to the root of this project (the same folder as this README.md file) and enter
    play run
This will start the server on your local machine.	

Now open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:9000]. You will be prompted with a red screen asking you to apply a database migration. Hit Apply.

The splash screen of the applioation should now load.
